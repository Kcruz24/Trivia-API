# Udacitrivia!

### Description
This is the final project of Udacity's Full Stack Web Dev Nanodegree second 
course. The project is about a trivia game which have multiple categories that
you can choose from, some categories are: Sports, Entertainment, Arts, 
and more! You can do the following things in the app:

1. Display a list of questions - You can see all of them or see them based on a
specific category.
2. Search for questions you might be interested in.
3. Add questions your own questions to make the game more enjoyable!
4. Play the quiz game with random questions based on a selected category or
with all questions from all categories altogether!
5. Finally, you can also delete questions you don't like!

My job was to implement all the backend code for the Trivia 
API. The implementation includes basic error handling and testing with Python
unittests (All errors are formatted to be returned as JSON objects as 
well as the routes), performing full CRUD operations (mentioned above), and
creating all routes following best practices.
Also, all routes follow the REST arquitectural style.
                                                            

### Code Style
The backend is built with Python utilizing the Flask micro framework and 
follows the PEP8 code style guidelines.
